**PONG**

**Controls**

Player one will use "W" and "S" keys to move up and down to try and hit the ball to the other side. Player two will use the "UP" and "DOWN" keys
to move up and down. In order to exit the game, the user will have to use the ESC (Escape) button. 

**Coding Methods**

We wanted to keep in mind three key things when designing Pong: the objects in the game, the score and the overall presentation of game. 
  1. We used the inheritance of classes to create new subclasses that would describe the Players and the Ball in the game, utilizing this idea to create fluid interactions with our code.
  2.  The score board which was programmed with pygame functions gives the game a point to be played and allows the players to compare their scores and who wins.
  3.  By using RGB codes and pygame functions, we personalized the game to our liking, creating a clean and sleek GUI to look at.

 **Final Thoughts**

 In the future, I believe we should try to expand on the game itself, creating gamemodes on the base game so there is more playability for users as a whole.
