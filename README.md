**How to Play Blackjack**

Blackjack is a card game played between a dealer and one or more players. The goal is to get a hand with a value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21.

**Setup**

	1. Blackjack is played with a standard 52-card deck.
	2. The cards 2 through 10 are valued at their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are valued at 10. Aces can be valued at either 1 or 11.
	3. To begin, players place a bet in the betting area in front of them.
 
**Play**

	1. The dealer deals two cards face up to each player and two cards to themselves, one face up and one face down.
	2. The player goes first and can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (take no more cards). The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over.
	3. If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and immediately lose their bet.
	4. The dealer draws cards until their hand value is 17 or higher, at which point they must stand.
	5. If the dealer busts, all players who did not bust win.
 
**Winning**

	1. If the player gets closer to 21 than the dealer without busting, the player wins an amount equal to their original bet.
	2. If the player and dealer tie, it is a "push" - no money exchanges hands.
	3. The dealer pays out any winning bets and collects losing bets.
	4. Play continues with new bets and newly dealt cards.
