**How to Play Blackjack**

Blackjack is a card game played between a dealer and one or more players. Our Blackjack does not have an Dealer and is only played with a group of players who will compare their scores.
The goal is to get a hand with a value closer to 21 than the other players without going over 21.

**Setup**

	1. Blackjack is played with a standard 52-card deck.
	2. The cards 2 through 10 are valued at their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are valued at 10. Aces can be valued at either 1 or 11.
	3. To begin, the player must first input the number of players that would be present.
 
**Play**
	1. The first player gets randomly chosen an card.
	2. The player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (take no more cards). The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over.
	3. If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and immediately lose.
	4. If the player is playing with multiple players, the program will move onto the next player and read their inputs. Program continues until there are no players left.
 
**Winning**

	1. Whoever busts, instantly loses against all other decks. 
	2. If the player stands, those who have the highest score of cards wins. (Example: 15 < 19 )
	3. Any player who gets an 21, instantly wins against all other decks unless someone else also gets 21.
	4. If any players are equal in score, the game continues until someone wins.
